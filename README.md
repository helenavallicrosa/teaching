In this repository, I am including the R materials I designed and created for teaching purposes.

Course 1.845: Terrestrial carbon cycle and ecosystem ecology, led by Prof. Cesar Terrer.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Civil and Environmental Engineering department
Introduces the terrestrial carbon cycle in a climate change context, with a focus on ecosystem ecology and biogeochemistry.

Description <br/>
These are the materials included in the practical sessions on course 1.845: Terrestrial carbon cycle and ecosystem ecology. Their goal is to provide students with tools and good practices to face data analysis applied to earth sciences using R. Then, the students can practice those skills by using the provided data and following the process of data curation, data analysis, and interpretation. The students are going to learn the basics of R programming, the highlights of C cycle modeling and modeling in ecology, how to work with maps and geographical information systems, the basics and how to use data synthesis techniques such as metanalysis, and how to use machine learning to upscale the results.

Prior knowledge <br/>
We are initially targeting students interested in earth systems and environmental sciences, willing to acquire basic skills and good practices to face, analyze, and interpret data. No previous knowledge of programming is required.

After attending the sessions, the students are expected to be able to:

1.	Describe what R is and its characteristics, the different types of data, and data structures.
Be able to use R to load and store data and use basic functions such as “subset”, “unique”, ”hist”, ”colnames”, ”order” or ”cbind”.
Create and interpret basic linear models.
Formulate simple loops and functions and familiarize yourself with good practices to maintain a tidy workflow.

2.	Explain the uses of C modeling and its scientific implications.
Use a one-box carbon model and a two-box carbon model in R.

3.	Explain the differences between raster and vectorial maps, as well as the importance of the resolution and projection concepts.
Use R to read and visualize raster and vectorial maps, and change projections and resolution.
Use R to create stacks and crop maps.

4.	TO BE FILLED BY CESAR

5.	Discuss the advantages and limitations of machine learning algorithms.
Create subsets for the train-test-validation and explain why they are necessary.
Choose the best machine learning model based on your data.
Tune, display, and understand the model.
